This application will return 10 still giphs from the Giphy API. When the application first loads it will have a theme of animals. However, the user can add a botton with any theme they would like. 

Once they have pressed one of the available options the application will fetch 10 still giphs for that topic. If the user clicks on any of the giphs it will toggle the playing giph.
